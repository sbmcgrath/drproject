thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever lived in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse sha;; light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber
Blood and destruction
And dreadful objects so familiar
